    "script" : "It is a celebration of one of America's favorite foods: the sandwich! It is no coincidence that November 3rd is also the birthday of John Montagu, the fourth Earl of Sandwich. This 18th-century English noble wanted to eat his meal with one hand during a 24-hour gambling event, so he instructed his servants to serve him his lunchmeat between two slices of bread. To commemorate the birth of the world's first sandwich-maker, November 3rd is now National Sandwich Day!"
